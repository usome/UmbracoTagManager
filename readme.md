# Umbraco 13 Tag Manager

This package installs a custom section within the Umbraco administration area.

## Credits
This package is #friendly courtesy of [Nigel Wilson](https://our.umbraco.com/members/id:6116/), who built the initial package a zillion years ago. We converted and polished it with his consent - again - #h5yr Nigel.

For v7 websites, please use the original =splendid= package by Nigel: [Tag Manager for Umbraco 7](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/tag-manager/).

For V8 websites, use our previous version: [Umbraco 8 Tag Manager](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/umbraco-8-tag-manager/).

## Collaboration and Suggestions
We are open to suggestions and collaboration to build upon this lovely package. This package is part of our ongoing package development and will be updated frequently with new features.

## Features
The package provides a tiled overview of all tags used in Umbraco. Each tag shows where it's used and how many times. Tags can also be created in advance so they show up in the content document type in the autocomplete.

The tree is split into separate branches for each tag group created, which is useful if you run multiple blogs on your site or have multiple tag groups defined in a site.

### Functionality includes:

- Ability to edit tag data
- Ability to delete tags
- Tags on nodes/media are updated with edited tags
- Indication of how many times the tag is currently being used (number in brackets)
- Ability to move all tagged nodes to another tag - useful in cases of spelling mistakes, cleaning up tags, etc.
- Links to content where the tag is used.
- The ability to create new tags
- The ability to search and filter tags
